    Learn how to react on events.

LiveSession [event stream](https://livesession.io) was designed to be a powerful tool helpful for example in monitoring and alerting purposes.
It allows you to react on events in real-time and take actions based on them.

## Quickstart
Alerts delivery can be configured in two ways. First, you can use third party delivery provider like [Slack](https://livesession.io).
Second, you can set up a custom workflow using [webhooks](https://livesession.io). All methods receive events in real-time.

```bash Creating a webhook
curl https://api.livesession.io/v1/webhooks \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIVESESSION_PAT" \
  -d '{
    "website_id": "YOUR_WEBSITE_ID",
    "url": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL",
    "version": "v1.0",
  }'
```

Once you have a webhook set up, you can create an alert to receive events in real-time.

The main duty of alerts is to filter events and send them to the configured delivery provider.
You can for example create a [custom event](https://livesession.io) and based on that event send a message to your server.

## Creating an alert
Alerts gives you a robust control which events you want to receive.
You can use [built-in](https://livesession) events like `Error Click`, `Network Error` or based on [custom event](https://livesession) which gives you a full control of
what and when you want to monitor.

```bash Creating an alert
curl https://api.livesession.io/v1/alerts \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIVESESSION_PAT" \
  -d '{
    "name": "YOUR_WEBSITE_ID",
    "provider": "webhooks",
    "webhook_id": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID",
    "events": [
      {
        "kind": 26,
        "value": "YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT_NAME"
      }
    ],
  }'
```
<Callout>
    Based on above example, please make sure you used [Browser SDK](https://livesession.io) custom event tracking like `__ls("track",
    "YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT_NAME")`
