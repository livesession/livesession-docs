## Overview

Funnels allow you to define a sequence of steps (events or pages) that represent a process in your application, such as completing a purchase or signing up. These sequences help you understand user behavior at each stage and where users might abandon the process.

With the LiveSession API, you can programmatically define, query, and analyze funnels to optimize user journeys.

## Creating a Funnel

You can create a funnel by specifying the steps users should take to complete a goal. For example:

```bash Creating a Funnel
curl https://api.livesession.io/v1/funnels \\
  -X POST \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIVESESSION_PAT" \\
  -d '{
    "name": "Signup Funnel",
    "steps": [
      {
        "event": "Visited Signup Page"
      },
      {
        "event": "Filled Signup Form"
      },
      {
        "event": "Completed Signup"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

This example defines a funnel for the signup process. Each step corresponds to a specific event tracked in LiveSession.

Querying Funnel Data
Use the LiveSession API to retrieve data about user progress through a funnel. Here's an example of querying data for a spec

```bash
curl https://api.livesession.io/v1/funnels/{id} \\
-X GET \\
-H "Authorization: Bearer $LIVESESSION_PAT"
```

Replace `{id}` with the ID of the funnel you want to query. This request returns data about user progression, including the number of users completing each step.

Analyzing Drop-offs
Funnels provide insights into where users drop off. For example, if many users abandon the funnel after visiting the "Signup Page" but before "Filling Signup Form," it might indicate issues with the form or its visibility.

To analyze drop-offs, retrieve the funnel's breakdown by step:
