**User paths** allow you to uncover how users interact with your app by analyzing their navigation and actions. With this feature, you can:

        Understand the steps users take to complete critical workflows.
    </Steps.Item>
    <Steps.Item>
        Identify points of friction or abandonment in user journeys.

## Overview
User Paths work by leveraging the events generated by user activity in your app. These events are captured, organized, and [visualized](https://livesession.io) to provide detailed insights into [user behavior](https://livesession.io).

For developers, our experimental **query language (`queryx`)** can be used to interact with these insights programmatically. While optional, `queryx` is a convenient tool for advanced queries. [Learn more about `qx`](#).

## Querying
The `qx`  provides a structured way to create advanced queries for user path analysis. Here's an example:

```javascript Query US dashboard
import qx from '@livesession/qx'

qx()
  .range("2024-01-01", "2024-12-31")
  .where(
    qx.session.events.path.includes("/dashboard"),
    qx.session.user.geo.country.eq("US")
  )
```

This query fetches user sessions where users visited `/dashboard` and are based in the United States during 2024.

## Advanced filtering
Use filters to identify specific patterns and behaviors:
- Track steps leading to [conversions](https://livesession.io/docs/conversions).
- Segment users by [demographics](https://livesession.io/docs/segments) or activity.
- Detect bottlenecks in workflows.

## Real-world use case
Imagine you're analyzing why users abandon the checkout process. Here's how you can use [user paths](https://livesession.io):
<Steps>
    <Steps.Item>
        Identify the flow of users reaching the `/checkout` page.
    </Steps.Item>
    <Steps.Item>
        Detect drop-off points or repeated actions that indicate friction.
    </Steps.Item>
    <Steps.Item>
        Programmatically query sessions with specific filters, such as device type or location.
    </Steps.Item>
</Steps>

```javascript Query mobile checkout
import qx from '@livesession/qx'

qx()
  .range("2024-12-01", "2024-12-10")
  .where(
    qx.session.events.path.includes("/checkout"),
    qx.session.user.device.type.eq("mobile")
  )
```

This example narrows down to mobile users interacting with the checkout flow within a given time range.

## Visualize user journey
In the [LiveSession Dashboard](https://livesession.io/dashboard), you can explore user paths visually:
1. Navigate to the **User Paths** section.
2. Use [filters](https://livesession.io/docs/filters) to focus on specific pages, actions, or users.
3. Analyze user journeys using flow diagrams and heatmaps.
