# Recording conditions

Using [newPageView](https://livesesssion.io) method you can specify your own conditions as a trigger for a recording.

###### **Examples:**
```js
__ls("newPageView", {
  conditions: [
    {
      type: "event",
      name: "MouseClick",
      operator: "contain",
      key: "path",
      value: ".add-cart",
    },
  ],
});
```
above condition will be fulfilled when user click on element where
`path` contain `.add-cart` value.
