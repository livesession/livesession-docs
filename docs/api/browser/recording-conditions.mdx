# Recording conditions

Using [newPageView](https://livesesssion.io) method you can specify your own conditions as a trigger for a recording.

## Example condition

```js
{
  type: "event",
  name: "MouseClick",
  operator: "contain",
  key: "path",
  value: ".add-cart",
}
```
This condition will be fulfilled when user click on element where "path" contain ".add-cart" value.

## Example use

```js
__ls("newPageView", {
  conditions: [
    {
      type: "event",
      name: "MouseClick",
      operator: "contain",
      key: "path",
      value: ".add-cart",
    },
  ],
});
```
