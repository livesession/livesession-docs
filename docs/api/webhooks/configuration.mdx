    Learn how to set up and configure webhooks in LiveSession.
</Subtitle>

**Webhooks** enable real-time communication between applications. When specific [events](https://livesession.io) happen, one app automatically sends data to another.
This integration streamlines workflows, syncs systems without constant polling, and integrates third-party services.

LiveSession triggers [webhooks](https://livesession.io) via preset events, with ongoing expansion.
When a configured event occurs, our systems promptly notify your servers, delivering detailed event data.

## Quickstart
You can customize your setup within LiveSession's Settings menu. In the `API > Webhooks` section, oversee the URLs that facilitate LiveSession's interaction with your servers.

        **Website:** The 'Website' field refers to an identifier for your chosen LiveSession-enabled website.
