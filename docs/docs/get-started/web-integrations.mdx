# Web integrations
:::subtitle
Learn how to integrate LiveSession with other web platforms.
:::

## Gatsby
1. Install [gatsby-plugin-livesession](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/@livesession/gatsby-plugin-livesession)
2. Go to gatsby-config.js
3. Configure a plugin like in following example:
```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `@livesession/gatsby-plugin-livesession`,
    options: {
      trackID: YOUR_LIVESESSION_TRACKID, // Required, string
      keystrokes: true || false, // Optional, default to false
      rootHostname: ".example.com", // Optional
    },
  },
];
```
Read more about an options you can provide [here](http://localhost:5175/docs/api/browser/methods).

:::callout
Plugin adds code to your site only in production mode.

## Capacitor

In general LiveSession support that technology, but you must be sure that resources on your app are available publicly on the Internet.

If you use local server for some reasons you'll need to pass baseURL option like the following:
```js
__ls("newPageView", {
  baseURL: "https://your-site.com"
});
```
:::callout
For example if you set up your [local server](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/config#schema)
with **hostname:'frontend', androidScheme:'capacitor-app'** and 
href to css in your app is /static/style.css the following style resource must be available 
at `https://your-site.com/static/style.css` assuming you set baseURL to `https://you-site.com`
:::

## Electron
Electron doesn't natively support cookies, so LiveSession JavaScript web tracking code won't work because internally we use client-side cookies. We're currently working on a of the electron-cookies package to support tracking.

:::callout
In the future we'll switch to another browser storage instead of cookies and Electron should works out of the box.
:::

So, to use LiveSession in Electron apps you should:

1. Install electron-cookies package
2. Configure a like in following example:

```js
import ElectronCookies from '@livesession/electron-cookies';
// enable
ElectronCookies.enable({
  origin: 'https://example.com'
}); // or ElectronCookies.enable() for default
// disable
ElectronCookies.disable();
```
The browser cookies needs to know the current URL, but in Electron files are usually served from local filesystem which is not compatibile with cookies. Treat origin as a special key for cookies store within all data is saved.
