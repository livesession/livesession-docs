            # Custom
            Triggers when a custom event is handled. These events are made during recording through the `__ls(“track”)` Browser API function.
            The payload includes event specifics and potential validation errors for added properties.

            The properties field is a map with varying value types. Value type depends on the property key.
            For instance, "_str" suffixed keys hold string values and "_bool" suffixed keys contain boolean values. Additional details are available in the knowledge base.
