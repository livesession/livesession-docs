# Recording conditions

Using `newPageView` method you can specify your own conditions as a trigger for a recording like:


:::code-group{title=""}
```js sdk
import ls from "@livesession/browser";

ls.newPageView({
  conditions: [
    {
      type: "event",
      name: "MouseClick",
      operator: "contain",
      key: "path",
      value: ".add-cart",
    },
  ],
});
```

```js window
__ls("newPageView", {
  conditions: [
    {
      type: "event",
      name: "MouseClick",
      operator: "contain",
      key: "path",
      value: ".add-cart",
    },
  ],
});
:::

above condition will be fulfilled when user click on element where path to [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) element contain `.add-cart` value.
