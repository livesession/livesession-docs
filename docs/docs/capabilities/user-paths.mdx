**User paths** allow you to uncover how users interact with your app by analyzing their navigation and actions. With this feature, you can:

        Understand the steps users take to complete critical workflows.
    </Steps.Item>
    <Steps.Item>
        Identify points of friction or abandonment in user journeys.

## Overview
User Paths work by leveraging the events generated by user activity in your app. These events are captured, organized, and visualized to provide detailed insights into [user behavior](https://livesession.io/features).

For developers, our experimental query builder **queryx(`qx`)** can be used to interact with these insights programmatically. While optional, `qx` is a convenient tool for advanced queries. Learn more about [qx](https://github.com/livesession/qx).

    `qx` is still an experimental project. Share your [feedback](https://github.com/livesession/livesession) with us to help improve it.

## Querying
The `qx`  provides a structured, type-safe way to create queries for a user path analysis. Here's an example:

```js Query /dashboard path within US in some range
import qx from '@queryx/qx'

qx()
  .range("2024-01-01", "2024-12-31")
  .where(
    qx.session.events.path.includes("/dashboard"),
    qx.session.user.geo.country.eq("US")
  )
```

This query fetches sessions where users visited `/dashboard` and are based in the United States during 2024.

## Real-world use case
Imagine you're analyzing why users abandon the checkout process. Here's how you can use user paths:
<Steps>
    <Steps.Item>
        Identify the flow of users reaching the `/checkout` page.
    </Steps.Item>
    <Steps.Item>
        Detect drop-off points or repeated actions that indicate friction.
    </Steps.Item>
    <Steps.Item>
        Programmatically query sessions with specific filters, such as device type or location.
    </Steps.Item>
</Steps>

```javascript Query mobile checkout
import qx from '@queryx/qx'

qx()
  .range("2024-12-01", "2024-12-10")
  .where(
    qx.session.events.path.includes("/checkout"),
    qx.session.user.device.type.eq("mobile")
  )
```

This example narrows down to mobile users interacting with the checkout flow within a given time range.

## Advanced queries
Utilize the `qx` to construct sophisticated queries for in-depth user path analysis.
This powerful tool allows developers to create detailed queries that can expose intricate patterns in user behavior. <br/>

Here's an illustrative example:

```js Query subscription journey
import livesession from 'livesession'
import qx from '@queryx/qx'
import subscription0x from '@queryx/subscription-0x'
import ijs, {$} from "@interaction-js/ijs"

const ls = new livesession();

const subscriptionUrlsUsage = [
    "plan-and-billing"
]
const query = qx()
    .where(
        qx.session.events.path.includes(subscriptionUrlsUsage),
        qx.session.events.click.target(
            ijs.stream([
                $.SubscribeButton({plan: "pro"}),
                $.SubscribeButton({plan: "basic"})
            ]),
        )
    )

/*
// alternative query using `0x` concept:

const query = qx(subscription0x).downgradeSwitch("pro", "basic")
// `downgradeSwitch` is a custom function in `0x` space
*/

const journeys = await ls.journeys.find(query)

console.log(journeys)
```
