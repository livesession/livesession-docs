# Funnels
<Subtitle>
    Analyze user behavior and optimize conversion flows with funnels.
</Subtitle>

Funnels in LiveSession enable you to track and analyze the steps users take within your app to reach a desired outcome. Use this feature to:
<Steps>
    <Steps.Item>
        Identify drop-off points in key workflows.
    </Steps.Item>
    <Steps.Item>
        Measure the performance of your conversion funnels.
    </Steps.Item>
    <Steps.Item>
        Gain actionable insights to improve user engagement and retention.
    </Steps.Item>
</Steps>

## Overview
Funnels allow you to define a sequence of steps that represent a process in your application, such as completing a `purchase` or `signing up`.
These sequences help you understand [user behavior](https://livesession.io/features) at each stage and where users might abandon the process.

With the LiveSession API, you can programmatically define, query,
and analyze funnels to optimize user journeys.

## Compute
Thanks to compute you can analyze user behavior and conversion rates. Use the following API request to compute a funnel:

```bash Computing a funnel
curl https://api.livesession.io/v1/compute/funnel \\
  -X POST \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIVESESSION_PAT" \\
  -d '{
