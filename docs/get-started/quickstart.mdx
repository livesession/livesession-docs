### Learn how to start with LiveSession.
LiveSession is a powerful tool that helps you understand how users [interact](https://livesession.io) with your product.
This guide will help you get started with LiveSession and start capturing [user interactions](https://livesession.io) and analyzing them.

## Install LiveSession

        <>
            This is the simplest way to get LiveSession up and running. It only takes a few minutes.
            <br/>
            Copy the snippet below and replace `ls_api_key` and `ls_abc` with your project's values,
            then add it within the `
            <head>` tags at the base of your product - ideally just before the closing `</head>
            ` tag.
            This ensures LiveSession loads on any page users visit.
            <br/>
            You can find the snippet pre-filled with this data in [your project settings](https://livesession.io).

            <Details kind="secondary" title="(recommended)" label="Set up a reverse proxy">
                We recommend setting up a reverse proxy so that events are less likely to be intercepted by tracking
                blockers.
                <br/>

                We have our [own managed reverse proxy service](https://livesession.io) included in the Teams plan,
                which routes
                through our infrastructure and makes setting up your proxy easy.
                <br/>

                If you don't want to use our managed service then there are several other
                [options for creating a reverse proxy](https://livesession.io),
                including using [Cloudflare](https://livesession.io),
                [AWS Cloudfront](https://livesession.io), and [Vercel](https://livesession.io).

## Send events
Once your LiveSession instance is up and running, the next step is to start sending events.

We recommend starting with [autocapture](https://livesession.io) for your web app as it's the quickest way to get set up,
gives you full coverage, and avoids manually adding custom events.
On top you can add custom events to track the most important events.

<Callout>
    **Tip:** Autocapture sends lots of events. We provide a generous free tier but as you scale you might switch to
    mainly
    using [custom events](https://livesession.io) on the areas of the product that are more stable and
    [tune autocapture](https://livesession.io) to your needs.
