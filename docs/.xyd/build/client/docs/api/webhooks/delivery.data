Learn how LiveSession delivers webhook events to your endpoints.\n</Subtitle>\n\n## Overview\nWhen an event ready for [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) transmission occurs within LiveSession, an event payload is crafted.\nIf you've set up endpoints for that specific event type, the payload gets lined up for delivery.\n\nThese \"trigger-ready\" events encompass actions ideal for webhook interaction.\nFor instance, when a session event is created, it's trigger-ready.\n\nEvent delivery typically takes mere seconds, though a strict [FIFO order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) isn't assured.\nGiven potential event volume, the webhook platform prioritizes throughput over rigid sequencing.\n\nOnce an event is dispatched, a payload signature is computed and included in the request.\nThe request sent to your chosen endpoint bears these details:\n\n<Steps>\n    <Steps.Item>\n        HTTP method is `POST`\n    </Steps.Item>\n    <Steps.Item>\n        Content-Type of the request body is `application/json`\n    </Steps.Item>\n    <Steps.Item>\n        There will be a request header named `LiveSession-Signature` - this includes the request signature which the recipient should verify.\n    </Steps.Item>\n    <Steps.Item>\n        Every request body will contain a JSON object with the following fields:\n        <Steps>\n            <Steps.Item>\n                `message_id` - the message identifier\n            </Steps.Item>\n            <Steps.Item>\n                `webhook_id` - the webhook identifier\n            </Steps.Item>\n            <Steps.Item>\n                `webhook_type` - the webhook type\n            </Steps.Item>\n            <Steps.Item>\n                `api_version` - the webhook API version\n            </Steps.Item>\n            <Steps.Item>\n                `account_id` - the account identifier\n            </Steps.Item>\n            <Steps.Item>\n                `website_id` - the website identifier\n            </Steps.Item>\n            <Steps.Item>\n                `created_at` - the message creation timestamp\n            </Steps.Item>\n            <Steps.Item>\n                `payload` - the event payload\n            </Steps.Item>\n        </Steps>\n    </Steps.Item>\n</Steps>\n\nBelow is a representation of the entire HTTP request:\n\n```bash\nPOST /webhooks HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nLiveSession-Signature:

overwhelmed or unintentionally participating in a service disruption on your webhook endpoint,\nLiveSession limits the number of events sent for a given webhook to a maximum of `1000 per minute`.\n\nIf you've configured an endpoint for a high-volume event flow, like a frequently triggered custom event during user sessions,\nexpect possible webhook delays.\nWhen the number of events for an endpoint exceeds `1000 per minute`, the extra events will be queued].\n\nIf the events happen really fast for a little while and then slow down, all the events might still arrive, but it could take longer than when they first happened.\nBut if the fast rate continues for a long time, some events might not be delivered.\nIf an event is undeliverable for `24 hours`, it's treated as **failed**, and no more tries will be made.\n\n<Callout>\nThe limit of 1000 events per minute is per account.\n</Callout>\n\n## Retry behavior\nLiveSession attempts to deliver a given event to your webhook endpoint for *up to 8 hours* with an exponential [backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)\nin `beetwen 1-10 minutes` interval gap from the previous attempt."]
