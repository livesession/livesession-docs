Funnels\n:::subtitle\nAnalyze user behavior and optimize conversion flows with funnels.\n:::\n\nFunnels in LiveSession enable you to track and analyze the steps users take within your app to reach a desired outcome. Use this feature to:\n:::steps\n- Identify drop-off points in key workflows.\n\n- Measure the performance of your conversion funnels.\n\n- Gain actionable insights to improve user engagement and retention.\n:::\n\n## Overview\nFunnels allow you to define a sequence of steps that represent a process in your application, such as completing a `purchase` or `signing up`.\nThese sequences help you understand [user behavior](https://livesession.io/features) at each stage and where users might abandon the process.\n\nWith the LiveSession API, you can programmatically define, query,\nand analyze funnels to optimize user journeys.\n\n## Compute\nThanks to compute you can analyze user behavior and conversion rates.
